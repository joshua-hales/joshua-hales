## About Me

I am currently a Junior in Computer Science at Utah State University. I enjoy learning how things work in detail. My
curiosity and determination assist me when I tackle ambitious projects. One such project was a custom electric guitar
that I designed and built using tools including Autodesk Fusion 360 and CNC machinery. I hope to create and contribute
to some cool projects in the future.

You can check out my blog [here](https://joshua-hales.github.io) for more details about things I do.
