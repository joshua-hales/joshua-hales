## About Me

I am currently a Junior in Computer Science at Utah State University. I enjoy learning how things work in detail. My
curiosity and determination assist me when I tackle ambitious projects such as when I designed and built an electric
guitar from scratch. I hope to create and contribute to some cool projects in the future.
