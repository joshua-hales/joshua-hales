## About Me

I am currently a Senior in Computer Science at Utah State University.
I also work as a Software Development Intern at Dell Technologies.
I enjoy learning how things work in detail.
My curiosity and determination assist me when I tackle ambitious projects. One such project was a custom electric guitar
that I designed and built using tools including Autodesk Fusion 360 and CNC machinery. I hope to create and contribute
to some cool projects in the future.

You can check out [my blog](https://joshua-hales.github.io) for more details about things I do.
