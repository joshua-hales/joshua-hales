# About Me

I'm a constant learner, always excited to dive into a new topic.

Some of my current interests are:

- Open Source Software 
- Security
- Privacy
- Law

I am currently a Software Engineer at Dell Technologies.
I graduated with a BS in Computer Science from Utah State University.

My curiosity and determination assist me when I tackle ambitious projects.
One such project was a custom electric guitar that I designed and built using tools including Autodesk Fusion 360 and CNC machinery.
I hope to create and contribute to some cool projects in the future.
